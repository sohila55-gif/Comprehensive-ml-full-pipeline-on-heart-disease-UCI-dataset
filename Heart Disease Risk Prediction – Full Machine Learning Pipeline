Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps for insight into patterns and relationships.

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space while retaining variance.

Feature Selection: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Chi-Square tests, and model-based importance ranking.

Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models with accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC, and AUC evaluation.

Unsupervised Learning: K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering with elbow and dendrogram analysis to uncover hidden structure.

Model Optimization: GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and performance improvement.

Deployment: Optional Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions and visualization, with Ngrok for public sharing.
